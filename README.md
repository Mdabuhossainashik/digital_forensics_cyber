# Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity
Welcome to the world of digital forensics in Cybersecurity.
> A collection of digital forensics tools for verification, investigations, diagnostics, software, libraries, learning tutorials, frameworks, academic and practical resources in Cybersecurity. 
> Thanks to all contributors, you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you! Our goal is to build a categorized community-driven collection of very well-known resources.

## What is Digital Forensics?

- Computers are increasingly being used in criminal activity. From fraud to violent crime, computers are often found to play a significant role as a tool for planning and conducting a crime, and may contain relevant evidence pertaining to an offence. 

![forensics](https://github.com/paulveillard/cybersecurity-digital-forensics/blob/main/img/Forensics.png)


- **Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that focuses on identifying, acquiring, processing, analysing, and reporting on data stored electronically. Electronic evidence is a component of almost all criminal activities and digital forensics support is crucial for law enforcement investigations.**
